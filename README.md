# Google Search Appliance - JSON Frontend

This JSON generator in XSLT is specifically to match the GSP format XML that is generated as a common format for many search implementations.

The JSON wraps everything in one master node 'GSP', then handles results by wrapping those (if they exist) in GSP/RES.

It currently needs some more work in relation to sanity checking but thankfully the format imposes lots of restrictions on that anyhow.

## Known Issues

* Currently not supporting v7.0+ (although it works)
* IE8+ does not treat output always as JSON (Quick fix in JQuery does correct this)

This project is undergoing active review.

## Todo
* Test cases
* Sanity checks
* JavaScript Examples
* Other client features
